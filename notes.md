# Course notes

## TS Type System

- Helps us `catch errors during development`.
- Uses `type annotations` to analyze codebase. Comments that describe the purpose of the code/information flow
- Only active `during development`. Code is compiled into Javascript.
- Doesn't provide any `performance optimization`. Different to other languages.

Typescript is compiled into Javascript using `tsc`. Typescript is never executed. The Javascript is. Node doesn't know what Typescript is.

Think of Typescript as a `coding helper`. It helps us catch errors, but doesn't impact the final output.
